# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! This repository contains my solutions for the __Advent of Code 2023__ puzzles.

## File Structure

The repository is organized in a simple file structure. The top-level folders are `days` and `lib`. The `lib` folder contains a `File` class and a `helper.hpp` file. The `days` folder contains folders for each day of the challenge (01, 02, 03, etc.). Each day folder contains a `test.txt`, `input.txt`, and a `main.cpp` file.
<pre>

    ├── 02/ 
    │ ├── test.txt 
    │ ├── input.txt 
    │ └── main.cpp 
    └── ...
</pre>

The `test.txt` file contains the test data for the corresponding day's puzzle. The `input.txt` file contains the input data for the puzzle. The `main.cpp` file contains the solutions code for the puzzles.

## Progress

I am striving to complete as many challenges as possible, but I also have some exams coming up. Therefore, I will do my best to solve the puzzles and update this repository with my solutions as I progress through the challenge.
